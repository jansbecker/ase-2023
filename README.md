# Evaluation Model for "Providing Evidence for Correct and Timely Functioning of Software Safety Mechanisms"

This repository contains the evaluation model for the paper

Jan Steffen Becker, Björn Koopmann and Ingo Stierand: *"Providing Evidence for Correct and Timely Functioning of Software Safety Mechanisms"*, submitted to FMICS 2022

It is based on the [MobSTr dataset](https://github.com/panorama-research/mobstr-dataset/releases/tag/2021-06) created by 

* Salome Maro, Chalmers University of Technology | University of Gothenburg
* Jan-Philipp Steghöfer, Chalmers University of Technology | University of Gothenburg
* Marc Zeller, Siemens Technology
* Maria Bonner, Siemens Digital Industries
* Björn Philipp Koopmann, German Aerospace Center
* Jan Steffen Becker, German Aerospace Center
* Ingo Stierand, German Aerospace Center
* David Schmelter, Fraunhofer IEM
* Jörg Teßmer, Robert Bosch GmbH
* Harald Mackamul, Robert Bosch GmbH
* Mikael Köse Jansson, University of Gothenburg
* Lukas Krawczyk, University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Dortmund

The repository contains only those parts of the MobSTr dataset that are relevant for the above publication, for the followwing reasons:

* MobSTr provides a rich set of different artifacts, and only a few of them are relevant for the publication. Hence, it may be hard to find the relevant contributions in the complete dataset.
* The AMALTHEA models have been migrated from app4mc-1.0.0 to app4mc-2.0.0 which is not yet (i.e., at time of writing) targeted by the official [CAPRA release](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.capra/releases/0.8.2). This breaks the installation instructions for the original dataset. 
* Some parts of the model have been changed in order to fit the application of the paper. This leads to inconsistencies with other artifacts in the original MobSTr dataset. 

The contained files are

* `mobstr-mapped+safety.amxmi`: The modified AMALTHEA model
* `*.model`: The analysis model for the RTana2sim model checker
* `*.btf`: Example traces generated by the RTana2sim model checker with the satisfaction and virtual integration tests

The AMALTHEA model can be opened with [app4mc-2.0.0](https://www.eclipse.org/app4mc/downloads/). BTF files can be inspected for example with [Trace Compass](https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/).
